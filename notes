What is the difference between library and framework ?

-developer have the control and decides when and how to use the library's function.
-they are designed to provide specific functionalities.
-developer can choose which parts of the library to use and integrate them into their application.
-eg: jquery, ajax


Framework:
-Frameworks provide a pre-defined structure and control the flow of application. The developer builts the application by filling in the framework's structure with their code.
-Frameworks are generally larger in scope than libraries. They encompass a set of tools, rules and conventions for building applications.
-eg:Angular, Django.


what is crossorigin ?
-It is used in CDN links to control how browsers handle cross-origin requests when fetching resources, such as javascript files, from a different domain. It is use to ensure proper security measures are in places.

-The crossorigin attribute can have two values:

"anonymous": This is the default value. It indicates that the resource should be fetched without including any credentials (such as cookies or HTTP authentication) in the request.

"use-credentials": This value indicates that the resource request should include credentials. The browser will include appropriate credentials (like cookies) when fetching the resource.

-cross-origin refers to http request from a web page that orginates from one domain to a different domain.
